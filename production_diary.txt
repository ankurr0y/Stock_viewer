March 22nd, 2021 Monday - Searched for API to pull stock exhcange data. API can only do current day's data.
			- Made base check all html program.
			- Made program to traverse a range of dates
March 23rd, 2021 Tuesday - Couldn't find an API which could traverse all dates on NEPSE. So made own API to do so.
			 - Experimented with the following DBMS options: sqlite3, MySQL, PostgresSQL and Mongo DB, eventually settled for sqlite3.
			 - Tested API for showing a specific date. Date was 2010-05-09 (first date with data on the website).
			 - Each date is stored in its own SQLite file in the Database folder.
			 - Started downloading each day from 2016-1-3 to present day one month at a time using date traversal over the website.
			 For example,"nepalstock.com/main/today/index/?startDate=2016-1-3" is today's index for that day.
			 - By looping the dates, we can parse each date available on the website.
			 - Because of public holidays such as Dashain, Holi etc many days dont have data and the loop needs to be started again.
			 - The market is also closed on Fridays and Saturdays so those days need to be skipped.
			 - Started collecting the database, got upto half of 2016.
March 24th, 2021 Wednesday - Started collecting rest of database upto 24th March. Took approxx 12 hours.
			   - There are no entries from mid-March through April 2020 because of COVID and only 2 entries in May.
			   - Stock market resumed activities normall on 29th of June.
March 25th, 2021 Thursday - Created program to get all the filenames in a folder. In this case, the Database file.
